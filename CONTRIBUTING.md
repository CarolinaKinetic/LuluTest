# Contribution Guide

If you would like to contribute to development, please pull the latest version of development,
create a local branch with a descriptive name, write your code, and push the branch to the
repository. After this, create a pull request for your feature branch to the development branch.
Please do not create PRs against the master branch.

Pull requests without tests will most likely be rejected unless the work you've done is minor
enough that a test would be overkill. As of writing the readme, the project is not big enough
to enforce too many more guidelines than this.

Keep in mind, this framework is designed to be a tool for software testing and quality
assurance, lets practice what we preach.

## Issues Label Guide
* Beginner Friendly - Issues tagged with this label are so tagged because they are likely within the realm of a novice Pythoneer
* Bug - These issues are functionality-breaking issues that prevent the software from doing what a user would expect
* Documentation - These issues revolve around documenting the system with things like READMEs, set up guides, various Wikis, etc
* Duplicate - Issues will be marked duplicate if they have already been addressed
* Enhancement - These issues are for taking LuluTest from what it is now, to what we want it to be. It includes adding features as well as refactoring
* Good First Issue - These are issues that will help newcomers to the *project* in getting acquainted with the project, not neccessarily new programmers
* Help Wanted - These issues are either beyond the expertise of the current contributors or need further discussion with someone who knows about the issue at hand
* Integration and Management - Issues around building a CI server, setting up a Slack chat, and deployment/packaging solutions fall under this label
